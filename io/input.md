# Unveiling Bergmann’s Rule in Ectotherms: Pattern and Processes associated with geographic gradient in body size in North Atlantic Reef Fish

## Topics

### Body Size:

- The study of geographical variation in biological traits across species has been a fundamental aspect of natural sciences since the 19th century

- Body size significantly influences various processes at individual, population, and species levels, shaping ecological dynamics, niche adaptation, and broader evolutionary trends -- fitness

- Organisms exhibit profound ecological and evolutionary shifts owing to changes in body size, impacting their ecological roles, interaction dynamics, and even extinction probabilities

- Morphological variation often aligns with changes in body size, suggesting a more frequent occurrence of ecological shifts due to changes in size rather than shape (Alencar et al, 2022).

- The complexity of body size, influenced by multiple selective pressures and dimensions, poses challenges in deciphering general patterns of size evolution (Clarke 2021; Alencar et al, 2022).

**Bergmann's Rule**

- Bergmann's rule, proposed by Carl Bergmann in 1847, suggests that the geographic distribution of animal species is influenced by body size alone: smaller species prefer warmer climates, while larger ones require colder climates (Vinarski, 2014).

- This hypothesis predicts a relationship between body size and climate: larger sizes in colder regions, which aligns with the macroecological concept known as Bergmann's rule (Pincheira‐Donoso, 2010; Watt et al. 2010).

- Bergmann's rule has various definitions, often involving local latitude and/or temperature factors (Vinarski, 2014).

- Clinal phenotypic selection driven by geographical variation in temperatures leads to large-scale gradients of body mass variation within animal clades, supporting Bergmann's rule (Pincheira‐Donoso, 2010).

- **Arguments on Bergmann's Rule Validity**

- Arguments exist both supporting and refuting Bergmann's rule: some suggest it's an artifact or a byproduct of other adaptive processes (Vinarski, 2014).

- Different hypotheses, adaptive and non-adaptive, attempt to explain the observed geographic variation in body size, often linked to environmental factors like temperature (Vinarski, 2014).

- **Adaptive Hypotheses (natural selection):**

- Temperature-Dependent Adaptations: larger organisms, adapted for cold environments, have a lower surface-to-volume ratio, which aids in energy/heat conservation in low temperatures

- Selective Pressures in Different Environments: in warmer environments, other selective pressures might impact fitness, reducing the predictability of temperature-based effects on body size.

- Fine Adjustment of Growth Rates and development duration as mechanisms that lead to the optimal body size for particular conditions.

- **Non-Adaptive Hypotheses**:

- Geographic variation is determined by the direct modifying impact of environmental factors (for example, temperature) on animal body size.

**Arguments against Bergmann's Rule Validity**

- Taxonomic Artifact in Bergmann's Rule: due to insufficient taxonomic knowledge rather than being indicative of true adaptations to tempeadaptirature.

- Statistical Correlations with Body Size: Some non-adaptive hypotheses suggest that Bergmann's clines are not due to body size itself but rather to other traits that display statistically significant correlations with body size.

**Bergmann's Rule for Ectotherms**

- Endotherms, such as birds and mammals, often show evidence supporting Bergmann's rule with body size - Distinct physiological differences between endotherms and ectotherms hint at specific factors influencing the formation of Bergmann's clines, suggesting a need for more targeted investigations (Vinarski, 2014).

- Historical analyses by Ray and Lindsey supporting Bergmann's rule in ectotherms but with caution against generalizations

- Even closely related species may display different variation trends.

- Larger body size might be disadvantageous for ectotherms in colder environments due to the inefficiency of heat retention.

- Factors such as delayed sexual maturity at lower temperatures or growth advantages in cold-reared groups complicate the straightforward application of the rule to ectotherms.

- Even if temperature determines the final body size in a lot of cases, temperature alone is not determinative since its direct impact is countered by other factors in natural conditions

- Probably, there is an absence of a single universal explanation for Bergmann's variation in ectotherms, with multiple factors interacting at different latitudes.

- There is an alternative hypotheses, such as the suggestion that ectotherms might follow Rensch's rule instead of Bergmann's rule : the maximal size of organisms is recorded in localities with the optimal temperature for them. Thus, such organisms reach their maximal size not in the "north" or "south" but in the locality that may be in any part of their distribution range. (Vinarski, 2014)

**Bergmann Rule in Marine Fishes**

- Various studies support a positive correlation between fish size and latitude (Lindsey,1966). Although studies on freshwater and marine fish suggest variability in the application of Bergmann's rule (Fernández-Torres, et al 2018).

- Wimpenny (1941) observed larger fish sizes in tropical regions for marine fish.

- Lukin (1940) noted larger fish sizes in cold water.

- Elasmobranchs and teleosts collectively showed a trend of more small species in the tropics, - especially prominent in deep-sea fish (Lindsey,1966).

- Using mixed model with taxonomic hierarchy Bergmann's rule is supported by a latitudinal pattern in shallow water Actinopterygii body size, with larger species found at higher latitudes (Fernández-Torres, et al 2018).

- A latitudinal trend in fish size holds for marine fish communities in the North Atlantic, southern Indian, and Pacific Oceans (Fisher et al., 2010).

**Possible Mechanisms Underlying Bergmann's Rule**

- Rules are predictions about ecological phenomena under specific conditions.

- Mechanisms driving patterns in one system may apply across different systems.

- Larger body size at high latitudes may result from reduced tension in biotic relationships (predation and competition) \-- body size of predators is controlled by their prey size and the presence of competitors.

- McNab (1971) (Nonadaptive Hypothesis) links predator-prey dynamics to explain body size in weasels. Assuming predator size correlates with prey size, larger predators can consume food across a larger size range, and mean food size available to weasels decreases with increasing latitude.

- **Productivity pulse theory (**Rosenzweig,1968): primary productivity may be correlated with body size. The hypothesis predicts a reversal of body size with latitude, because the duration of the pulse is short at both low (tropical) and high latitudes (arctic)

- **Seasonality hypothesis** (Boyce, 1979; adaptive) suggests larger body size is an evolutionary strategy in resource-limited populations -- evaluated with climatic seasonality. The theory connects body size variation to the **seasonal availability and predictability of resources** in different environments. Here, body size in homeotherms is constrained by the time growing individuals have unhindered access to high-quality food - in environments where resources are seasonally abundant and unpredictable, larger body size in homeotherms. During periods of **resource abundance, larger animals can maximize their growth**.

**Mechanisms Underlying Bergmann's Rule in Marine Fishes**

- Temperature and Time to Sexual Maturity: Ectothermic species growing at lower temperatures mature more slowly and attain larger sizes (Fernández-Torres, et al 2018).

- Resource Availability: Larger body size corresponds to increased food resource needs, supporting a positive relationship with resource availability (Fernández-Torres, et al 2018).

- Osmoregulation: Larger species are expected to cope better with higher salinity levels due to increased osmoregulation capacity (Fernández-Torres, et al 2018).

- Anthropogenic factors, including climate change and fishing, can lead to body size reductions in marine fishes (Fernández-Torres, et al 2018).

- Size variation is influenced by Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Net Primary Productivity (NPP), supporting time to sexual maturity and resource availability hypotheses (Fernández-Torres, et al 2018).

- Unexplored hypotheses include abiotic factors, biotic interactions, historical factors, and anthropogenic factors.

- Scholander (1956) and Ashton et al. (2000) stress the need for deeper research into physiological interpretations.

**Objectives**

- In this work we aim to unveil abiotic mechanisms driving patterns of body size variance in Elasmobranchii and Actinopterygii, inhabiting reef environments at North Atlantic Ocean considering taxonomic diversity
