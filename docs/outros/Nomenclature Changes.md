# Nomenclature Changes in the PI Project, and a New Software Iniative

## Introduction

The PI Project has introduced key nomenclature changes and a key new softare initiative. This document aims to clarify these updates, ensuring consistency and clarity across all communications and documentation.

## 1. The PI Project

The overarching initiative will continue to be referred to as the "PI Project." To maintain a strategic focus on the project's goals and innovative nature, the full expansion of the acronym "PI" will not be used or disclosed in official communications.

## 2. Refinement in the Nomenclature

A significant evolution has occurred in the naming conventions related to the diacritical systems and scaffold-spelling. This evolution is represented as follows:

### 2.1. English Nomenclature

- **Formerly:** PI Scaffold-Spelling (PI or PISS)
- **Now:** English Diacritical System (EDS) and English with Diacritics (EwD)

The term English Diacritical System (EDS) now represents the system for applying diacritics in English text. English with Diacritics (EwD) refers to the actual English text that has been processed or adapted according to the EDS.

### 2.2. Portuguese Nomenclature

- **Formerly:** Ortografia Didática PI (PI or ODPI)
- **Now:** Sistema Diacrítico para o Inglês (SDPI) and Inglês com Diacríticos (IcD)

SDPI and IcD are the Portuguese translations for EDS and EwD, respectively. They are not different systems but rather the Portuguese names for the same concepts.

## 3. Intelligent Diacritic Placer API (IDP API)

Originating in the EDS/EwD era, the Intelligent Diacritic Placer API (IDP API) is the project's main software initiative, focused on the automated and intelligent placement of diacritics in texts. Going forward, all references to this component will utilize the abbreviation "IDP API" for simplicity and consistency.

**Conclusion**

These updates mark a significant phase in the PI Project, aligning the project's terminology with its refined focus and ongoing commitment to linguistic enhancement and technological innovation. The PI Project remains dedicated to advancing the fields of pronunciation learning and language processing.
